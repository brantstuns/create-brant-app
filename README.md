### I've found myself spinning up a lot of apps with this set up lately so this is to make it easier. I know about create-react-app, and it's cool, but it gives me more than I want and I always find myself needing a node server.

##### Create-nice-app spins up a very basic app setup, designed to just work and let you hit the ground running. I'm only imposing a few (ðŸ˜‰) of my opinions on you! However, it's really easy to swap pieces out so this serves as a nice minimal, modern  fullstack Javascript boilerplate generator.
