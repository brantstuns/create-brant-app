#### Create-nice-app spins up a very basic app setup, designed to just work and let you hit the ground running. I'm only imposing a few (ðŸ˜‰) of my opinions on you! However, it's really easy to swap pieces out so this serves as a nice minimal, modern  fullstack Javascript boilerplate generator.

### What you're getting:
Frontend: 
- React 15.5+
- SCSS
- React Router 4

Backend:
- Express

Testing:
- Jest 20
- Enzyme

Build:
- Yarn
- Webpack 2
- Babel
- Eslint w/ a modified Airbnb's eslint config
